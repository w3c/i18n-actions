# i18n-actions

Action item tracker for the [W3C Internationalization Working Group](https://www.w3.org/International/).

This repo is used solely for tracking tasks and actions of the Working Group. Generally this is done by the WG chair or using ghurlbot in WG calls or meetings. If you feel the need to raise an issue here, please contact the chair (@aphillips) or staff contact (@xfq).

If you want to comment on a document that the WG produces, please use the issues list for the repo where that document is produced. For comments on articles and tutorials, it makes life slightly easier if you use the "Leave a comment" link at the bottom right of the article page.
